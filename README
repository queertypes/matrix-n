For a successful build, a compiler supporting recent c++11 features 
should be used. In particular, the following features are important:
- rvalue references
- std::move support
- <chrono>

Project structure:
- numerical
 * matrix interface
 * matrix generation
 * detail
  o matrix implementation interfaces
- implementation
 * implementation of generator and matrix interfaces
 * detail
  o implementation of compute classes
- src
 * drivers and applications

Planned implementations:
- serial
- serial-simd
- parallel
- parallel-simd
- gpu
 * CUDA
 * OpenCL
- hybrid

Targets:
- x86 (primary)
- ARM (secondary)

Objects with multiple implementations:
- matrix
- determinant
- inversion
